# bliss_work.slim

The idea of this blog is to expose one's professional abilities, what they are currently working on, and their future aspirations. Nothing fancy, easy to skim and get the main idea of.

Help get one employed and show others their new projects. It is built off of the source code from *slim*.

## Making the site your own

> **The idea:** A site for your vocational endeavors. Post your resume, cv, talks, academic works, projects, and a little bit about your professional self all in one website!

A basic site using plain colors to keep the focus on what you've done professionally and how you might be changing directions in life. All using a blissful approach. Nothing fancy.

## Your Phrases

The site comes with phrases to make your work more blissful. Create words and sentences that excite you for your *dream job* or *something you really enjoy!* All the phrases can be created and found in the `_config.yml` file. They are

* `bliss_phrase`
* `project_desc`
* `works_description`
* `work_summary`

Explaining each, the `bliss_phrase` is something related to your vocation. It is about you goal or aim about the things you wish to do professionally. For example, if you were to be a mathematician working in manufacturing boxes of orange juice (layout, design, optimization), you could write:

```
bliss_phrase: >

  Optimizing even the littlest things...
```

It's something to help give your blog a good mood or atmosphere. Next is the `work_description` which is just a section explaining or briefing the reader about your works, what they are, and how you might have used the ideas. An example writing for it could be:

```
work_description: >

  Mathematical works and cool papers, used often to compress large data into small packets...
```

In the `project_desc` a basic description of what your projects are about and a smooth introduction to guide the reader into exploring more about them. An example project description could be

```
project_desc: >

  Nice projects about optimization, constraints, and packaging solutions. New ideas for the times ahead!
```

Lastly, the `talks_summary` is an introduction or a summary about what most of your talks are about.  An example could be...

```
talks_summary: >

  Recent talks, meetings, and things trying out...
```

## Talks (posts)

This is your talks section. It's a place for your recent ideas and just short notes. Maybe what's going on recently and other things like insights from meetings and the cool new things you've learned on a *month to month* basis. The idea is to keep learning during the vocation and hone your skills to be versatile for times ahead. Be flexible and adapt well to change and okay with new opportunities. Embrace your new talents gained as time goes and escape routine mentality.

### Keys (tags)

Each talk has 1 tag (called 'keys' on the site) that is like a category. It organizes your talks. You can have 'os_development', 'cool_ideas', 'learning_from_mistakes', 'nice_improvement', just keep them positive and show others your talents.
