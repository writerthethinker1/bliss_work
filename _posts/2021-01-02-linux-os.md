Just finished a cool new linux os backup recovery system. Had to present the findings to company and soon it's going to be global, all at a user friendly price of $0!

No more lost files! Have a better backup!

Basically, we had to re-do the file system and increased the encryption.

The code given for it is

###### Cool title!

```
recover.start()

while not found():

  disk.search()
```
It's new way of storing them...
