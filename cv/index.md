*Just some cv tips, erase and write your own!*

### Writing that CV: Let's get hired!

If you know how to write a resume, then writing a cv is easy. The basic items all cvs have that resumes also have are:

* biographical data
* academic background
* previous positions (including volunteer-work)
* research
* teaching
* examinations
* publications
* personal interests
* personal statement/objective (if you want)

Of the above, your biographical data, academic background, and previous positions are all included in any resume. The format itself is also basic too, use the same fonts like "Times", "Tahoma", and "Robato" and use bold headings as well as bullet points to make an 'easy to read' type appeal. List format is also helpful and the layout is basic and resembles that of a resume too (see the example below). The best items to include for any of the above points are the date(s), location(s), role(s), and *how that experience makes you a good candidate for the position*.

> Part of what makes a CV appealing to the reader is the layout in addition to what you've done. If you have done several ground-breaking works, but the design of the CV is not clear or basic, it's going to be hard to have a response. The average time it takes for a cv to be read is 6 seconds; you will be amongst 200+ applicants. Be sure to stand out! You are amongst other well qualified candidates for the job too!

**You don't have to go into depth about what you've done**, but what you do share, make sure you share how what you have done affects your skills and **tips the decision towards you**. How has volunteering at a homeless shelter led to greater teamwork skills? Ability to communicate well with others? Coordination skills? Things along this nature or line of thought.

> You want to make sure to show how all of the above points led to you being a nice fit for the job. Explain succinctly and well. Customize the cv for any job position you want, include relevance to job position. How do the things you give to the reader show you'd be a good candidate for the job? Make this as easy to see as possible, nothing that requires too much effort looking for relevance to position. At convenience of the reader, basically.

Just don't go above 2 pages! Good cv's are 1-2 pages only. Again, if you have done a lot, then trim it down to the most important things that are really relevant to the job you want. Don't include things that won't help the employer think you're a good fit. As in, you are applying for a desk job in telecommunications and have as extra jobs as a dog walker. It does little to help show the employer your skills in communicating well with people, the dog walking job. Best leave it out.

### Having trouble?

Sometimes it helps us know what we have done by routinely having an *accomplishment journal* where we note

* what we have done on the job
* how we learned from it
* what we have accomplished in school projects
* what we have accomplished in work projects
* our skills in life
* times we were adaptable to the situation
* times we didn't let setbacks stop us from doing what we wished
* how we did more than what we thought we could do
* times worked well with others for a common goal/project

It helps show your strengths and helps write the main resume. A more clear description of yourself for the employer.

> A review by some people you know in the field you are applying for might also help, their experience can also guide you in writing a noticeable cv.
