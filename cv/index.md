## Writing that CV: Let's get hired!

If you know how to write a resume, then writing a cv is easy. The basic items all cvs have that resumes also have are:

* biographical data
* academic background
* previous positions (including volunteer-work)
* research
* teaching
* examinations
* publications
* personal interests

Of the above, your biographical data, academic background, and previous positions are all included in any resume. The format itself is also basic too, use the same fonts like "Times", "Tahoma", and "Robato" and use bold headings as well as bullet points to make an 'easy to read' type appeal. List format is also helpful.

> Part of what makes a CV appealing to the reader is the layout in addition to what you've done. If you have done several ground-breaking works, but the design of the CV is not clear or basic, it's going to be hard to have a response. The average time it takes for a cv to be read is 6 seconds; you will be amongst 200+ applicants. Be sure to stand out!

You don't have to go into depth about what you've done, but what you do share, make sure you share how what you have done affects your skills. How has volunteering at a homeless shelter led to greater teamwork skills? Ability to communicate well with others? Coordination skills? Things along this nature or line of thought.

> You want to make sure to show how all of the above points led to you being a nice fit for the job. Explain succinctly and well. Customize the cv for any job position you want, include relevance to job position. How do the things you give to the reader show you'd be a good candidate for the job? Make this as easy to see as possible, nothing that requires too much effort looking for relevance to position. At convenience of the reader, basically.
