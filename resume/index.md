# Make that Resume Outstanding!

### What's Helpful to Put...

Include who you are, promise of value, and why you deserve to be sought. Try to get noticed professionally! Have a professional summary that uses *active voice* and is *clear in speech*. Things like...

* 'developed software X', 'executed projects', 'initiated development into new programs', 'advised workers on skills', and 'maximized revenue for part of company X'

> companies have 100+ resumes to look over in little time, you want yours to be out of the ordinary, easy to read, and promising...

Use easy to read fonts like *Robato*, *Times*, *Times New Roman*. Also have a plain layout with lines and *apparent contact information*. Make contacting and skill showcasing a priority, make it easy for them to contact you and ask further about what you've accomplished. Written at their convenience.

Show quantifiable achievements and how the employer might value you..

* what did you do to make what you know your own?
* what problems/challenges did you face? how did you overcome them?
* as a result of overcoming challenges, what did you gain?
* how did your efforts help the company or organization you worked/volunteered for?
* anything you did without anyone asking you to do it?
* ability to make compromises during work?
* ability to adapt to changes in work?
* what are your *noteworthy achievements?*

Use relevant keywords, short and simple but eye catching

> fast learner at X. enjoyed working on team on project X.

Show that you can do work/projects consistently to the end, even when it is a long project.

### Layout

Have contact information *in the very beginning*, on the top of the resume: name, address, cell, email, and other things you think will help them reach you for the job. Make your name stand out! *Include an address if you are applying locally*.

> Email tip: for a professional email, have the format as 'firstnamelastname@email.com' as in 'rickjones@email.com' don't use funny names that make it harder for them to contact you! As in 'partytime@email.com', it makes it harder for the company to identify you and isn't professional.

Then, have your *relevant skills for the job.* Each job requires different skills and descriptions, *adapt your resume for each position you want to work.*

> Don't use the same old resume if the work type is different. Make it custom for the position.

Things like *skills*, *projects*, *previous vocations*, and *volunteer work*. Relate this to how you've learned and become more skilled. How did the experience make you more professional? skilled? good for the position?

> Tip: try to keep it 1 page, at most 2 just for readability (format). If you have a lot of achievements, write only the most important ones or the really great ones. Basically, all of the most important information for the job is on 1 page maybe 2 just to make it more readable.

### Checking it...

It helps to *proof-read* the resume to make it more effective, check for...

* typos (misspelled words, sentences, grammar)
* lofty grammar or speech (no big words or writing few can understand quickly and get the point)
* easy flow: both visually and in reading ability


### Having trouble?

Sometimes it helps us know what we have done by routinely having an *accomplishment journal* where we note

* what we have done on the job
* how we learned from it
* what we have accomplished in school projects
* what we have accomplished in work projects
* our skills in life
* times we were adaptable to the situation
* times we didn't let setbacks stop us from doing what we wished
* how we did more than what we thought we could do
* times worked well with others for a common goal/project

It helps show your strengths and helps write the main resume. A more clear description of yourself for the employer.
